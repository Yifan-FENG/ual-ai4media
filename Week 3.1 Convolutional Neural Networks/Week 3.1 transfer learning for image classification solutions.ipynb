This means instead of training a CNN from scratch, for most of the weights of the network we will be using pre-trained weights trained on another dataset. This is surprisingly effective, especially when using pre-trained weights from a very large and general purpose dataset like imagenet. \n",

You can refer back to [last weeks instructions](https://moodle.arts.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=954147) if you get stuck.
