You will be installing Python using a package called Miniconda. 

This will give you Python, as well as some useful packages that youâ€™ll need, as well as a way for you to manage and switch between different python environments (more on that later), and install new packages and libraries.

This is a lightweight version of a larger package you may have heard of called Anaconda. If you already have Anaconda installed, you can ignore the rest of this set up for now!

## How do I know if I have conda installed?

### Mac OSX

Open up a Terminal and type ``which conda``

### Windows

Open up a Terminal and type ``where conda``

If its says something to the effect of ``conda not found``, then you are good to go!

## Installing Miniconda 

Go to the [Downloads page](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) and get the installer for **your machine**

### Mac OSX

Is your Mac an M1? If so, get the correct installer (Miniconda3 macOS Apple M1 64-bit pkg)! 

Older intel Macs shoudl use (Miniconda3 macOS Intel x86 64-bit pkg)

### Windows

You probably have a 64 bit machine (Miniconda3 Windows 64-bit)

Follow the instructions on the installer that runs 

## Check Installation 

Close any open Terminals or Command Prompts, then **reopen** a new one 

### Mac OSX

* ``which conda`` should return a message 
* ``which python`` should return a file path to a miniconda installation 

### Windows

* ``where conda`` should return a message 
* ``where python`` should return a file path to a miniconda installation
